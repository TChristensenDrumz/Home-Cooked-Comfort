# Home-Cooked-Comfort
## User Story
As a user stuck in quarantine, I want to search for new recipes to make while stuck at home. I should be able to filter my search based on food type and allergies.
<br>
WHEN I load the home page
<br>
THEN random recipes are appended to the page that lead to recipe pages
<br>
WHEN I search for specific food types on the recipe page
<br>
THEN recipes of that type should appear to view
<br>
WHEN I enter allergies on the recipe
<br>
THEN recipes that include those allergens should not appear in the recipe list
<br>

## Summary
We have created a simple recipe search to help add some variety to your quarantine meals. It is complete with random recipe suggestions, filters for a variety of dietary restrictions, local weather to help you decide what you are in the mood for, and a unit converter for all your measurement needs.
